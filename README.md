# Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Brian!

I'm interested in embedded development and Computer Engineering, but I am also excited in Computer Vision and ML. I also am really interested in simulations of different processes!

I also enjoy the process of working with software, particularly in the backend.

## Languages
- I am currently focusing on my C, Rust, and Python development and projects.
- I'm proficient in C, Rust, Python, C++, Java.

## Current Goals
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on emulator, OS, and embedded developments.
- Iâ€™m currently working on a Computer Vision dance bot and instrument note overlay; AI storyboard; and Architectural simulators.
- I'm working on uploading my projects here, had a factory reset a bit ago and will likely be ready to do so during a break time.
